# Orbital parameters playground

This app is inspired by upcoming the [Influence](https://influenceth.io) game, which plays heavily around orbital mechanics.
It will allow for experimenting with orbital parameters and visualizing their effect on the orbital shape on the go.

Run by ´npm install´ and ´npm run dev´.

Can be demoed [here](https://red-sand-07cb3eb03.azurestaticapps.net) but no guarantees of permanent availability.

Initialized as a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) application using [Vue 2](https://vuejs.org/). 
Using [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com) as the WebGL engine and [influence-utils](https://github.com/Influenceth/influence-utils) to compute orbital positions.
