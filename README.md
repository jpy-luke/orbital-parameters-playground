# Orbital parameters playground

This app is inspired by upcoming the [Influence](https://influenceth.io) game, which plays heavily around orbital mechanics.
It will allow for experimenting with orbital parameters and visualizing their effect on the orbital shape on the go.
At the time of writing this, it is a simple prototype demonstrating core library usage.

Run by ´npm install´ and ´npm run dev´.

Initialized as a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) application using [Vue 2](https://vuejs.org/). 
Using [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com) as the WebGL engine and [influence-utils](https://github.com/Influenceth/influence-utils) to compute orbital positions.
